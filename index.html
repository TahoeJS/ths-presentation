        <p class="fragment fade-in">I did not grow up in a home of engineers</p>
        <p class="fragment fade-in">I did not get into coding until I was 25 and it was by accident</p>
        <p class="fragment fade-in">I was working in Mountain Operations at Heavenly</p>
        <p class="fragment fade-in">I started taking some classes at LTCC</p>
        <p class="fragment fade-in">and that lead to dabbling with some web stuff</p>

            <li> Every industry uses some sort of tech today.  Even the low/no technology industries have some sort of technology driving their processes. </li>
            <li> What is the lowest tech industry you can think of? Can we find tech in it? </li>
            <li> Consulting jobs are flexible but can require a lot of hours.  You are always looking for that next job but you can be your own boss.  You will work with a lot of different techs performing a lot of different roles. </li>
            <li> Financial and Health Care industries are usually behind the times in technology and you can end up supporting long running products with prooven solutions </li>
            <li> The point of this is that every while every industry is different they all involve solving a lot of the same problems.  Ig you can code in one, you can code in any one. </li>
